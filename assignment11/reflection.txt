Static visualizations present data in a fixed format, suitable for reports or presentations but limited in flexibility. 
In contrast, interactive visualizations allow users to engage with the data—zooming, filtering, and exploring details—making analysis more dynamic and insightful.

Dashboards offer a powerful way to explore real-time data. They update automatically, helping users monitor key information,
 spot patterns quickly, and make informed decisions without needing to dig through raw data.

Tools like Plotly and Dash enhance how professionals share data by turning complex information into interactive visuals. 
This makes it easier for teams to explore, understand, and communicate findings clearly and efficiently.
